      	<P>Student ID: S3921235
        <BR>Email Address: S3921235@student.rmit.edu.au</P>
        <P>I was born and raised in Australia and am originally from Queensland and am now currently living in Victoria. My highest level of completed education is high school, this is the first study I have taken since then.
        <BR>A fun fact about me is that I can solve a Rubik’s Cube in under 2 minutes.</P>

			<H2>Interest In IT</H2>
		  	<P>From a young age I always had a fascination with computers, the internet and gaming, this was my introduction to IT and I was hooked on each of these aspects right away.
				<BR>Going from the days of dial-up internet and the Nintendo 64 to envying of other countries internet speeds and 4K gaming, it’s hard for me to not have an interest in technology and a desire to see where it is going to be in the future.
				<BR>It was in grade 9 when in class I first got to look inside a computer and get a hands- on experience with how they worked, it was then that I knew I wanted to work with computers when I grew up
				<BR>I have chosen to come to RMIT because I have a friend has taken this course as well and they very highly recommended it for me. They really like the course and that gave me the reassurance I needed to start my study.
				<BR>Throughout my studies, I expect to pick up not only the skills I want for my ideal job, but also the skills to take on any line of work in the IT field that presents itself to me.</P>

				<H4>Description and Why It Appeals To Me</H4>
			 		<P>My ideal job is being a System Builder for both personal and professional clients. The job requires me to put together systems to the client’s specifications/requirements and to ensure the system is in working order before it is received and work out any issues that pop up along the way. This job appeals to me as I love building computers) which I have only gotten to do a handful of times, but that was all I needed to fall in love with it) as well as problem solving.</P>
			 	<H4><BR>Skills Required For This Role</H4>
	 				<P>This job requires a lot of technical knowledge of computers and how their components interact and what grade of components work well together. Additionally, you need to be able to put a system together and know how to make it all look neat and tidy. Along with knowledge of the hardware side of computers, you need a knowledge of operating systems and software to ensure the system is fully functional before going to the client. You also need to be able to troubleshoot both hardware and software issues as they arise and have the skills to resolves any issues that do occur.</P>
	 			<H4><BR>Skills I Currently Have</H4>
		  		<P>I currently can build a computer as well as the ability to resolve some light troubleshooting. I can also set up bios settings once the computer has been built to ensure the computer is running optimally. Though this skillset isn’t especially deep, it covers the fundamentals of being a System Builder and makes for a great foundation for me to improve.</P>
	 			<H4><BR>Obtaining The Skills I need</H4>
	 				<P>Through the course of getting my degree, I feel I am going to pick up the theoretical skills required to truly accel in my career. I will need to get practical skills along the way too, I feel this will be attained through practical experience such as helping friends when they look to either build or upgrade their computers.</P>

	 		<H3>Myers Briggs Type Indicator</H3>
				<H4>INFP</H4>
					<H4>Strengths</H4>
					<P>The strengths of an INFP are that we are empathetic, generous, open-minded, creative, passionate and idealistic people. Ultimately, we excel at helping others to the fullest extent and feel the happiest and most fulfilled when we see others achieve what they set out to do.</P>
					<H4><BR>Weaknesses</H4>
					<P>The weaknesses of an INFP are that we are unrealistic, self-isolating, unfocused, emotionally vulnerable, desperate to please and self-critical. While we are excellent at helping others, helping outselves is not a strong suit for us, nor are we any good at giving ourselves a pat on the back when we achieve something. Our nature makes it easy for people to use us to get ahead.</P>

				<H4>Type 9 - The Peacemaker</H4>
					<P>The Enneagram Type 9 has been nicknamed the Peacemaker, and as the name suggests, they strive to find peace and harmony among all things. The Type 9 in part can encompass aspects from all other types, that can lend a hand to finding common ground among everyone. 9’s tend to avoid conflict where they can, going so far as to completely block it out if no other solution can be found.</P>
					<BR>
			<H3>Results Meanings To Me</H3>
					<P>These results indicate to me that I am someone who will be willing to help those around me and even go the extra mile for them. This may come at my own detriment however, as I can fail to prioritise myself over the needs of others.</P>
			<H3>How Will This Influence My Behaviour In A Team</H3>
					<P>In a team these results mean that I can be someone who assist others and will be able to defuse any situations that may arise. If anyone needs help, I will be the first to raise my hand with the confidence that I can help to the person’s standards and if I am not confident with what I am doing, asking for help and working my way through the task will strengthen my skillset</P>
			<H3>What This Means When Forming A Team</H3>
					<P>Everything came together to make it very easy for me to meet the other members of my team and be able to strike up a conversation with ease. It gave everyone the chance to be assured that I can be there to help if and when they need it even though I am at the starting line when it comes to the skills I wish to develop.</P>

		<H2> Project Idea</H2>
			<H3>Overview</H3>
				<P>My idea for the project is an application to help you organise meals for the week that will ultimately serve to help to reduce food waste. The way this will work is you enter the ingredients you plan on purchasing for a meal or two along with ingredients you already have on hand, the app will then offer suggestions of meals that use most of the same ingredients while taking into account things like how much of each ingredient is in the pack when purchased from the store.</P>
			<H3>Motivation</H3>
				<P>The motivation behind this idea comes in two parts. Firstly, one of the most annoying tasks in my weekly schedule is planning my meals for the week. It’s something I have to sit down and really think about. Having an app that can help me choose other meals to cook throughout the week will be a time saver and give me one less thing to worry about.
				<BR>Secondly, and more importantly, food waste is a massive problem in society. Globally one third of all food is wasted and in Australia alone around 7.3 million tonnes of food goes to waste. This app would help to alleviate waste within everyone’s home and ultimately within our society.</P>
			<H3>Description</H3>
				<P>As mentioned in my overview, at a base level the app will function by looking at what ingredients you plan on purchasing as well as any you have in your home already that you would like to use, analysing how much of each ingredient will be used based off what you plan on making and then suggest other meals that use some or all of the same ingredients. As an example, if you plan on making burgers using mince, tomato, lettuce, cheese and the buns, the app will look at the ingredients listed and suggest that tacos as they would also use mince, tomato, mince, lettuce, and cheese. The recipe list will be achieved two ways, firstly there will be a database with recipes that the app will have access to, these will be common dishes found around the world, you will be able to add common dishes that you like to a shortlist that the app will prioritise suggesting. The second way is for the user to add their own recipes that the app will then add to the priority list for suggestions.</P>
				<P>The app will also have filters for personal taste, allergies, and dietary preferences such as vegetarian, vegan, lactose intolerant, nut allergy, etc, so that suggestions that don’t suit your lifestyle won’t appear. The app will generate a shopping list for you as well meaning that you won’t have to write the list yourself.</P>
				<P>When it comes to custom recipes, you will have the ability to share any recipes you create with others. You can either make them public, so anyone looking for meal ideas can find it, or your can make them private so only yourself and anyone you share with will have the recipe show up as a suggestion.</P>
				<P>Integration with shopping apps (Coles, Woolworths, and any others available) will also be introduced so that once you have your meals planned, you can send everything you need to purchase to the shopping app to allow you to place a click and collect order if that is your preferred method of shopping, rather than having to manually carry over everything you need to buy. Included with this integration will be suggestions of recipes based off of weekly specials and in season recipes that would normally be found on the supermarket’s website or in a magazine.</P>
			<H3>Skills required</H3>
				<P>There are going to be a wide range of skills that are required for this. The ability to code in Java for making the app will be essential. Along with coding, the ability to set up a server for the app to talk to (both setting up the physical side of the server as well as all the software too) will be a high priority. Another skill that will be required is graphic design so the app will look polished on the user’s side. These skills coming together will help the app to achieve everything it can be.</P>
			<H3>Outcome</H3>
				<P>The outcome of this app being successful will be that overall food waste is reduced in each household that uses this app. The more people that use the app, the more food that will not go to waste. I do not think that this app will be the sole reason that food waste starts to decline, however every little bit helps. The other aspect of this app that will mean it’s successful is everyone that uses having an easier time planning their weekly meals, which will ultimately give them more free hours in a week.</P>
